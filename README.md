# Real-Time Lexical Analyzer for C

A web-based **Real-Time Lexical Analyzer** for the C programming language that allows users to input C code and
instantly view its lexical components such as keywords, identifiers, operators, numbers, and more.

🔍 This tool was developed as part of a team project to demonstrate how lexical analysis works in compiler design, making it easier for students and educators to understand token generation in real-time.
